# News 
**[code in branch master]**

A webapp to publish news

The project contain:
- Client developed in React
- Backend developed in AdonisJs(Framework NodeJs)

The idea is to have a webapp where you can post news.

**News** was online until September 2021 and could be accessed via the url: https://news.hackin.online/

I had to take the site down due to Umbler (platform it hosted) no longer supporting NodeJs
